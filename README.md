# lasso_regression_using_jax
Implements Lasso regression in JAX with efficient hyperparameter tuning. Starts with random search, then refines via grid search around the best candidates. Final model is cross-validated to assess generalization and detect overfitting. Fast, modular, and built for experimentation.
